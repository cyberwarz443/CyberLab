## Telemetry stack overview

This environment intentionally separates monitoring, logging, and SIEM functions.

While there is overlap in data sources, each layer has a distinct purpose.

### Monitoring (Zabbix)
- Focus: availability, performance, and health
- Answers: *Is it up? Is it healthy? Is it degrading?*
- Strengths:
  - fast alerting
  - low false positives for operational issues
  - strong historical metrics
- Not intended for:
  - security detection
  - compliance validation
  - forensic correlation

### Centralized logging (Syslog + Grafana + Loki)
- Focus: raw event collection and search
- Answers: *What exactly happened on this system?*
- Strengths:
  - flexible ingestion
  - fast searching
  - long-term retention
- Used for:
  - root cause analysis
  - evidence during incidents
  - validation of patching and changes

### SIEM (Wazuh)
- Focus: security posture, vulnerability management, and compliance
- Answers:
  - *Is this behavior risky or suspicious?*
  - *Is this system vulnerable or misconfigured?*
  - *Are we drifting from baseline?*
- Capabilities:
  - host-based intrusion detection
  - vulnerability detection
  - file integrity monitoring
  - policy and configuration compliance
  - security-focused alerting and correlation
